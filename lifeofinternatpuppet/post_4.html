    <p>Hello, happy Friday everyone,</p>

<p>Well, this week was extremely very busy with lots going on!</p>

<p>So let’s get started!</p>

<p>The week started off by having a sync-up meeting with Norman where he was finding out about how my previous week was, as he was on holidays. In addition to this, he also informed me that in the coming weeks, I will have to deliver a presentation around Week 5 or Week 6. Stay tuned for this :)</p>

<p>We also decided how we are going to set up the system for verifying monthly logs for my university placement year report. Lastly, Norman was telling me to have a dedicated page called ‘Life of an Intern at Puppet’ as he thinks that this will really help the new interns joining the company next year and most importantly he enjoyed reading sections of my weekly updates each week.</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me this opportunity Norman, much appreciated!</p>

<p>After talking to Norman, I had a quick sync up with Ciaran and Daiana where I shared my thoughts on my new blog page called ‘Life of an Intern at Puppet’
Stay tuned for more information on this in the coming weeks :)</p>

<p>I also had my first triage session with Daiana where she was giving me a demo of the <a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">community management tool</a> and what it involves. Thanks for delivering such an amazing session!</p>

<p>After finishing the session with Daiana, I had a session with <a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula</a> on how to release a module, this week it was the <a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw/puppetlabs-accounts">puppetlabs-accounts module</a> which was released. Many thanks to Paula on such an interactive and informative session!</p>

<p>The weekly stand-ups for this week took place on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday as usual :)
I informed my team during these sessions of what I was doing each day and how much progress have be made in the training sessions etc.</p>

<p>I continued my <a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/pdksync/testing/2020/02/12/gem-testing-with-pdksync.html">PDK Sync and Gem Testing Training Session Part 2</a> with <a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena</a>.
I also got access to the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0ncEjj7XEY">YouTubeVideo</a> on the Pre-Release Testing Gems in the IAC Team. So, do check out the link for more information!</p>

<p>Also, the following topics were covered in the <strong>Part 2</strong> session of PDK Sync and GEM Testing:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of GEM Testing</li>
  <li>How to perform gem testing with pdksync</li>
  <li>Clone modules, update Gem file, create commit, push the changes and create PR</li>
  <li>Verifying the CI jobs</li>
  <li>Run module tests locally.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my free time during work, I started to compile the introduction for my new blog page coming out soon and also shared my ideas with the IAC Team during the Show and Tell Session on Wednesday Afternoon.</p>

<p>Was it a busy start to the week? Well… there is more to come!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I had a quick sync up with Norman where I told him about the university project I will be a part of called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eeecsSST">Sustainability Technology</a>.
Check out the Facebook page or contact me directly for more information about the project!</p>

<p>I met Ciaran and Daiana with regards to doing the setup for the new blog page ‘Life of an Intern at Puppet’</p>

<p>I continued to work with Paula on the module release process and did some debugging on some of the <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Ruby exercises tutorial</a> for example Exercise 48.
This is not yet finished and I plan to finish it off by early next week hopefully.</p>

<p>I also meet Ciaran and Daiana on Wednesday morning to continue the debugging session on <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex48.html">Ruby Exercise 48</a></p>

<p>I also continued the Ruby Tutorials by installing Sinatra for Exercise 50 where I will be developing <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex50.html">‘My First Website’</a></p>

<p>If you have any suggestions on this project, please feel free to contact me :)</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also attended the <a href="https://blm.btown-in.org/uploads/1/1/8/6/118615243/me_and_white_supremacy_workbook__final_book_.pdf">Whiteboarding Wednesday Session</a> where a nice discussion took place on a book called ‘Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad’
I was able to contribute in the conversation by sharing my uni experiences and made the chat interesting.
There will hopefully be a second session on it, so stay tuned and look out for relevant information in my next blog update.</p>

<p>Finally, on Wednesday I also attended the ‘Show and Tell Session’ where I got the opportunity to share my introduction page with the IAC Team during the knowledge sharing session.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ciaran and Daniel for sharing some great ideas with me and to the rest of the team for the layout of the blog page!</p>

<p>Well, it’s nearly Friday, isn’t it, no?</p>

<p>On Thursday, I had a session with Caoimhe regarding some Payroll Questions.
Followed on from this, I then had a session with Daiana on Tag and Release Session which was another part of Paula’s session from Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>Well, you must be wondering what did I learn in this session?</p>

<p>In this session, I learnt about release branch on GitHub, two key types of releases used by Puppet, tag command, change log file and what type of information is stored in it?
In addition to this, I also learnt about merge back and pull request method to release the version 6.3.0 for the <a href="https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/accounts/6.3.0">puppetlabs-accounts</a> module.</p>

<p>The issue was raised during the release and tag process, Daiana contacted Paula and Ciaran to solve the issue of missing version 6.3.0 on the tags branch of the puppetlabs-accounts module on Github.
This was fixed by using the tag command. Then, Daiana continued the session with me and the new verison 6.3.0 for the puppetlabs-accounts was released successfully.
Great work team, happy days :)</p>

<p>I then meet with Joanne Best, who is another HR manager at Puppet and we both had a great introductory session. Lovely to meet you Joanne :)</p>

<p>I also had a quick sync up meeting with Ciaran where I showed him the prototype of my introduction page for the new blog page - Life of an Intern at Puppet.</p>

<p>I then had a meeting with Daniel who guided me in the right direction of how to fix the blog post hyperlinks error, linking to individual blog pages.
At first, I tried to work on it independently using the information provided by Daniel, but wasn’t too sure as I was learning a new language called Jekyll - a version of the Liquid programming language.</p>

<p>The links I used for independent learning and for debugging the functionality of the loop included:-</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">Liquid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you to Daniel for helping me add the hyperlinks to the individual blog posts under the introduction page of the new blog ‘Life of an Intern at Puppet’ and modified the puppetlabs/iac application by adding a new document Life of an Intern at Puppet in the docs folder that will pick up all the future blog posts related to this document from the root directory.</p>

<p>Finally, on Thursday I had a last meeting later in the afternoon with Claire Cadman, the technical writer working for Puppet in the London Office. It was lovely to meet you too Claire and I hope to meet you in Belfast office some time during this year!</p>

<p>Yayyyyy….. it’s Friday….. Friday was pretty relaxing!
I started off my day by working on my new blog page where I wrote an update on Week 4, attended the Friday Wrap Up session on Zoom, had a meeting with Ciaran on running my blog page live and see how it looks!
Stay tuned for more information on this and when it will be released etc!</p>

<p>I also had a session with Daiana on a To-do-List which was sent to me yesterday after the tag and release session.
This was covered during the quick session on Friday noon time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please go to the repo and find the release branch</li>
  <li>Find the tags section</li>
  <li>Find the commit sha</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for this week!</p>

<p>Have a great weekend everyone and look out for more interesting and exciting information next week!</p>
