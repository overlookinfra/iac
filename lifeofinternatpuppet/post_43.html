  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I spent some time reading and listening to the following tutorials on JIRA during the long bank holiday weekend for the Belfast office.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/jira_overview.htm">JIRA_Overview</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-jira-software-2019?u=2098212">Learning_JIRA_Software</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to continue using JIRA for my IAC Confluence Wiki Revamp Project as I am still curious to learn how to write good JIRA tickets, track changes in sub tasks as well as move from one stage to next by updating status from open -&gt; accepted -&gt; in progress -&gt; ready for review etc. I also learnt that when a ticket/sub-ticket is under review, if there are more changes to be made after the review then I can update the status back to ‘in-progress’ if needed before resolving/closing the sub-ticket and parent ticket.</p>

<p>I also resolved some tickets this week:-</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1678">IAC-1678</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1684">IAC-1684</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I worked on the <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1701">IAC-1701</a> which was a third sub-task of the parent ticket <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1644">IAC-1644</a>. In the IAC-1701, I wrote my recommendations for the archived “Un-Approved Process” page. The recommendations got approved and the ticket got resolved.</p>

<p>I started to work on <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1702">IAC-1702</a> where some recommendations highlighted in the <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1701">IAC-1701</a> got changed several times to make the content valid for the revamped “Un-Approved Process” page.</p>

<p>I also had to re-open the closed ticket <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1642">IAC-1642</a> as I had to add a link to the revamped “Un-Approved Process’ page under the “Links” section of the “Puppet Approved Modules” page as well as to remove the broken link discovered under the “Links” section. After making these changes on the “Puppet Approved Modules” page, the ticket was resolved.</p>

<p>The status of the <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1702">IAC-1702</a> sub-ticket was updated from ‘in-progress’ to ‘ready for review’ on Friday 16th July.
I also updated the status of the parent ticket <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1644">IAC-1644</a> from ‘in-progress’ to ‘ready for review’</p>

<p>Have a nice weekend everyone,</p>

<p>See you next week!</p>
