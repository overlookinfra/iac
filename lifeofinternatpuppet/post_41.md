Hi everyone!

I had a lovely PTO last week! This week was busy as always with IAC Confluence Wiki Project.

I closed the following tickets and pages were made live on Confluence
- [IAC-1640](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1640)
The layout was changed for the 'Features/Tooling and Tasks' page and the colour coded column was removed before the ticket was closed.

- [IAC-1641](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1641)
The action points for the page 'Modules Team Triage Process' were updated in the Google Doc and within the above ticket.

- [IAC-1642](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1642)
- [IAC-1634](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1634)

- [IAC-1639](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1639)
When the above ticket IAC-1639 was under review, I got feedback from my mentor Paula and the new changes were made before closing the ticket.

I also added another page link called 'Show and Tell Schedule' within the New Start Guide under the section called 'Useful Reading Materials'
Check the new comments in this [ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1626) This ticket will be reopened again in the future to add some more links in the 'Useful Reading Materials' section.

I have also raised a ticket with IT support to unarchive a page called 'un-approved process page' as my team didn't have sufficient permissions to do this action. The Google doc was also updated with the latest comments. The content of the [existing ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1644) was updated to reflect the new changes for example the title, acceptance criteria and description were updated. I will work on this ticket once the page is unarchived.

I also worked on creating a new page in the IAC Confluence Wiki called 'IAC Community Day'
I enjoyed writing content for this page and this [ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1643) is currently under review so that the team can provide any feedback for further improvements.

The another ticket which is currently under review:-
- [IAC-1656](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1656)
Stay tuned more information!

I also created some more backlog tickets on this project which I will work on in the coming weeks.
- [IAC-1678](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1678)
- [IAC-1680](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1680)
- [IAC-1682](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1682)
- [IAC-1681](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1681)

That's everything for this week!

Have a nice weekend everyone!
