    <p>We didn’t scare Disha off, by the looks of things, so we must be doing something right :)
Disha has been working through some training material set out by the team and here’s how she’s been getting on so far, in her own words:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I am currently working on the learning VM quest guide with Paula, Daiana and Ciaran to solve an issue for verifying certificates. We hope to get this issue resolved soon so that I can continue with the learning VM training. The link to the Quest Guide for the Puppet Learning VM is <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also had a quick session with Ciaran to learn markdown language for writing weekly team blogs. I will be exploring markdown language via this <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">tutorial</a> provided by Ciaran. There will be a dedicated training session on markdown language in the coming weeks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you to the team of IAC for helping me this week in the training sessions!
I am now looking forward to next week and all the exciting stuff to learn!</p>
