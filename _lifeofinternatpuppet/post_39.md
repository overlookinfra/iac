Hi everyone!

This week was busy working on the IAC Confluence Wiki Revamp Project.

Last week I submitted these two tickets for review and had a follow up meeting with my manager and mentor this week going over the feedback.

- [Ticket 1](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1583)
- [Ticket 2](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1590)

After the meeting, I made the neccessary changes to the Google Document and the proposed new design of the IAC home page. I reached out to [Michael](https://github.com/michaeltlombardi) and [Ciaran](https://github.com/sanfrancrisko) regarding making some decisions on DSC Builder Revamp Project Scaffold and PDK resources.

- [Ticket 3](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1586)
I closed my first ticket on 'Updating User Stories Section in the Google Doc' on this project this week! Delighted to have it done!

I also had a sync up with Paula on Thursday morning and a few more decisions were made on the existing confluence pages. The action points/comments in the Google Doc were fixed.

This [ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1585) was resolved because it had some duplicated content and each page will have its own dedicated JIRA ticket where all the relevant feedback will be added.

I have also applied for some PTO next week and going to London for a family wedding! Looking forward to it!

That's everything for this week!

Have a nice weekend everyone!
