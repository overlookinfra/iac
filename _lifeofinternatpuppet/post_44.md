Hi all,

This week I finished my IAC Confluence Wiki Revamp Project and starts to wrap up my placement year with Puppet before my last working day on 12th August 2021.

I made my last page called "Un-Approved Process" live on Confluence after making some more changes to its content/layout earlier this week. The following tickets related to this page were resolved:-

- [IAC-1702](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1702)
- [IAC-1644](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1644)

I also resolved the [IAC-1656](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1656) ticket which was under review from last few weeks so that my IAC Daily Board on JIRA looks nice and tidy.

In the last few weeks of my internship, I will do the following tasks:-
- Start preparing for final year (save any useful resources which can help me during the final year & beyond)
- Reflect back on what I have learnt during my placement year with Puppet.
- Get the final placement report from my manager sent off to Queen's (either before my last working day or during the month of August)
- Housekeeping duties (deactivating relevant accounts/returning equipment etc.)

That's everything for this week!

Only 1 or 2 more blog posts to go before I finish on the 12th August to use up my pending holidays :)

Have a nice weekend everyone!

Enjoy the warm weather!
