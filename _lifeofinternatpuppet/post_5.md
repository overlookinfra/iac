Hi all,

This week wasn't too busy... but there are some key highlights to note...

The week started off as normal when I had a sync up with Norman on Monday morning, followed on from that I worked on the feedback received from Michael regarding my new blog page 'Life of an Intern at Puppet'.
Check out the link to the feedback received [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/117)

Once the feedback was fixed, I created a pull request for review and merge for Micheal's final sign off.

I also had a session with Ciaran and Daiana on Travis and AppVeyor training. A to do list was given by Daiana after the session. I got the opportunity to review the following content covered during the session as well as got access to some useful reading material!
- What is CI ? Why is used?
- What is Travis? --> find a module (no preferences, the one you like) --> go to tests and re-run a test or the entire suite
- Same for AppVeyor ( Choose a windows module)
- clone a module ---> find .travis.yml file
- [Reading Material](https://docs.travis-ci.com/)

On Tuesday, I had a sync up with Paula where I was discussing my meeting with Norman from Monday. The training session has been arranged with Paula on Thursday.
The purpose of these training sessions would be to prepare for the upcoming challenges by the end of the month such as giving a demo on Litmus to Norman. I continued to work on the [Learning VM Quest Guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide)
I attended the standup sessions this week, but on Tuesday's stand up I mentioned to Michael that the changes to the new blog page were fixed and I am waiting for his final approval.

Following on from this, the blog was signed off by Michael and it was live for the community. Please check the link [here](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/docs/life_of_intern.html)

Thanks to Jillian, David Schmitt, Christine Schmitt, Norman Heaney, Marc Mc Kinley, Nick Smyth, Jason Stewart, Nirupama Mantha, Sheena, Ciaran Mc Crisken, Michael T Lombardi, Caoimhe Carlin and all the uni friends for all their appreciation on the blog!

It's Wednesday... guess what? It's a month in Puppet already!
To highlight that milestone, I had a 30 days at Puppet review with Caoimhe where I had discussed my concerns, asked questions and verbal feedback was given to help the team develop and improve for future interns joining for placement year.

The link to my new blog page 'Life of an Intern at Puppet' will be shared on the virtual stalls at the Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University Graduate Recruitment and Placement Fairs, so check it out on 22nd October and 4th November respectively!

Thank you Caoimhe for all your continuous support over the last month or so!

I also had a very brief meeting with the personal tutor at Queen's University Belfast via the teams call after the session with Caoimhe.

I attended the show and tell session where I was given a demo on Honeycomb by David Schmitt. Thank you to David for such an interesting session!

As part of the Learning VM traning I was struggling to complete the section on Conditionals Statements, this was because I was having issues on editing files within VIM text editor. This training will be kept on hold until I do some initial training on how to use VIM before continuing my Learning VM Quest Guide.

On Thursday morning, I wrote this blog update, did a tutorial on [Pry](https://learn.co/lessons/debugging-with-pry), attended standup as well as a session on Litmus, Pry and How to Work with Modules later in the afternoon. I am looking forward to this session with Paula!

Finally, Friday will include the usual wrap up session for the Belfast Office to highlight the key achievements for this week. I will also continue my training on Introduction to Pry with Ciaran. A social hour for the IAC Team in the afternoon will be attended.

That's all for this week :)
