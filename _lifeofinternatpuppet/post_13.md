Hi all!

I had a very busy week with lots going on....

Some of the key highlights were:-

- Concat module testing was done (review written and shared with the team later in the week).
The testing for this module has been parked for now
- Backlog work assigned - fix layout of hyperlinks on the Life of an Intern Blog Page during the free time.
- Christmas Holidays applied! Looking forward to them!
- UK Respectful Workplace Training Completed!
- I paired up with Adrian to get the puppetlabs-haproxy module released (v4.4.0).
Check the link on the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/haproxy/4.4.0)
- Recap session with mentor Paula on release process, the forge and mergeback.
Thanks Paula for the useful session!
- Litmus testing on IAC Modules (related to the release of the new CI - Google Cloud Platform)
  Some of the modules tested to date included:-
  - [puppetlabs-apt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt)
  - [puppetlabs-motd](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd)
  - [puppetlabs-accounts](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts)
  - [puppetlabs-java](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java)
