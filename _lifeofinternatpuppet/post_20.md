Hello,

Not a lot to say for this week...

- I worked with Sheena on puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools failures and a JIRA ticket was raised on integration test failures as a sub-ticket.

- I continued to work on my first community ticket - Exclude Drafts from Module Report.

- Started to revisit some of the departmental training videos on Github.

Have a good weekend everyone!

See you next week!
