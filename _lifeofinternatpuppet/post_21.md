Hi everyone,

Some of the key highlights from this week included:-

- I started the week by drafting out my SMART objectives for the development plan.

- Attended the Eco-System Kick Off Sessions; DSC and Windows, Forge UX and focusing on the needs of the user, IAC as content facilitators, Module testing landscape, Cloud CI and the trusted contributors, PDK improvements and integrations, Litmus multi-node and UX, Telemetry and metrics. A wrap session on Friday to close the sessions!

- Informed Paula that the release on the puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools (v3.2.0) were put on hold due to failures on the module testing and that needed to be resolved by the team before the release goes out. The JIRA ticket was updated with this status. Also, the [PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools/pull/146) was closed and a new JIRA ticket will be created if needed for this release.
