Hello all,

I hope you all had a relaxing May day bank holiday weekend... I know for me it was definetely fun :)

I returned to work on Tuesday 4th May and had a busy start to the week, why?

As I had scheduled a meeting with the Belfast office UX Team on my current project 'Revamp IAC Confluence Wiki'.
The meeting was very productive, got some really useful feedback. Thanks for attending Rick, John and Emma.
I also created a new slack channel to keep all our communications on one group channel. Thanks Rick and John for all the advice and resources given so far to help me with the project. Very much appreciated!

I spent the rest of the week working on this project, coming up with new ideas every day, updating JIRA tickets and other related documentation according to feedback received from Norman. Thanks for the support as always Norman :)

That's everything for this week!

Have a lovely weekend, enjoy the sunshine everyone :)
