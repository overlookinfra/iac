Hi everyone, Another busy week is over!

- On the Triage Day Monday, I worked on the release prep process for the two modules; puppetlabs-tagmail and puppetlabs-apt.

- During the week I released some more modules.
    - puppetlabs-apache. This was uploaded manually onto The Forge.
    - puppetlabs-wsus_client and puppetlabs-vcsrepo. After uploading the new version on the forge  (v3.2.1) the mergeback pr was merged during next week's triage day.

- JIRA tickets were created for majority of the modules released in that week

**Module Release Prep**
    [puppetlabs-tagmail](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tagmail/pull/202) (v3.5.1)
    [puppetlabs-apt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/968)      (v7.7.1)
    [puppetlabs-vcsrepo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo/pull/493) (v3.2.1)
    [puppetlabs-apache](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2126) (v5.10.0)
    [puppetlabs-wsus_client](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-wsus_client/pull/151) (v3.2.0)
       The first release prep [PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-wsus_client/pull/149) was closed. This was because the tests were failing on AppVeyor due to 'legacy parameter error that adapts Pester 5 to Pester 4 syntax'.
  - A new pr was created, check [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-wsus_client/pull/150) to fix the error and the release prep was done again. Check the #151 PR for more details!
