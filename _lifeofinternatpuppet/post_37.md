- Working on my placement report for university deadline on Monday, glad to have it ready for submission. A special thanks to Paula and Norman for their useful feedback!
- I had a follow up meeting scheduled on Wednesday afternoon with Norman on reviewing the documentation for the IAC Confluence Wiki Revamp Project, thank you Norman for all the useful tips!
- I updated the content for the following blog posts so that I can add updated screenshots when giving evidence for my university placement report.
