## DevX Team Update

### PDK 2.2.0

PDK 2.2.0 was released earlier in the week.
This update brings two significant new features:

- Support for OSX 11, Debian 11, Fedora 32 & 34
- Ability to configure skipping validation on certain files within a project

We have also bumped the version of Ruby the PDK is running on from 2.4 -> 2.5.
Please note, Ruby 2.4 is still available for testing against Puppet 5 environments.

There are also a number of bug fixes and improvements.
Full details can be found [here](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/pdk.html).

### Goodbye James

Unfortunately we have to say goodbye to [James][James] who is leaving Puppet next Tuesday.
No doubt, many of you will be aware of the huge amount of contributions [James][James] has made to the Puppet ecosystem: James was the architect behind our IIS and DSC modules as well as the new autogenerated DSC modules; he touched nearly every part of Puppet that interacted with Windows across modules, Bolt, Puppet, and tooling; he co-designed and implemented the VSCode extension and language server, vastly improving the lives of everyone writing Puppet code; for the last four months he's led this team, providing guidance and unifying our vision around what developing and maintaining Puppet content can be. Whether it be Windows content, improving the functionality and experience of Puppet's products on Windows, the [Puppet VSCode Plugin](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vscode), - it's no exaggeration to say that his contributions have been many and significant.

We'd like to thank [James][James] for his contributions, support and leadership and wish him the very best of luck in the next chapter of his career!
